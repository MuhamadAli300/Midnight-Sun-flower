Little thought â€“ significant turn




I am writing my saddest lines
sitting in front of a big water
among greenned pebbles
with my wavering pen.


How sad and exciting at the same time
It is, to look at far rising sun
and to think about life and time,
It is none too soon to stop having fun.


Did I beat myself to earth?
Did I die in a pitiable manner?
Wait, don't I have any more time?...
I have! So I can move forth!


As far as I am still here,
passing my real life,
it is my duty to steer
my and others' boats while I am alive.









The Night Owl



Seeing darkness in the darkest
part of night
It is not stressed out but excited,
seeing meteors reflecting movement.


Darkness goes away,
It gets substituted by light,
colour of black lake becomes pure
and motionless landscape gets clear to the
eyesight.


After sometime, dark colour of day revives
as sun and moon keep replacing
each other in days and at nights
Like caravan, it moves, moves and moves.










Cursed world (for the poor)



If you want to curse the world,
curse it
Hate everyone, old greybeard,
seem to people confusing and weird!


Once, in the blink of eyes
you will see us in front of Almighty,
there you will see the same us crying
appealing to Him with lies.


However, God knows
who tries to stretch their lies
with shadows,
don't worry, greybeard
be proud that you are poor.

He, who created us
promised best parts of paradise
which is hard to reach for rich evils
who to you closed their hands.










Deepening in thoughts



Light is playing on the
dark surface of lake,
and I am lying under the Moon,
among books, not sleeping,
wide-awake.


Taking a rest and looking at blooms
I cheerfully deepen in thoughts,
about how I hate wasting time,
and this hatred makes me wonder
about why we don't ponder
how to make our lives sublime?

"How many us are there?
Almost eight billion"
I question and answer myself.
"We are all over the world
and what are we doing right now?"
I ask the moon gazing at her.

In response,
she utters incomprehensible sounds,
I try to figure them out
and finally start to understand,
she was saying with a harsh voice:

"Someone is playing games,
someone is chatting,
someone is gossiping,
nothing else."

This pulls me to my guides,
admiring with other bibliophiles
who have aversion to idleness,
and I dip into reading my books.









How many burdens have I passed?



How many burdens have I passed?
How much time have I spent here?
I don't remember
but I am sure
I can bear everything now
after all, I have passed through
a lot of burdens, and for the morrow
there left only a few.

I don't know how many days I have spent
however I know my age,
I got so old now that I can suddenly faint
and sit all day long in my dark cage
without anyone.









Thief's regret



For whole my life I have been a thief,
I was wandering along the way my job led
and killed my dreams and myself.

Right now I am old,
I tried several times to steal a piece of bread
but every attempt is in vain
I can't still realise why I spent
whole my life as evil
and suddenly became desperate.


Oh God, you are omniscient,
you see all my good and bad deeds
give me the last chance,
let me have a prosperous life,
let it become the 8th Wonder
of the world.


Oh Lord! Forgive your mortal slave!
Be merciful to me now than ever you were.
Forgive me! Forgive your slave!









Underground



He chose the same way as others
to go left and right
but not to go along underground
and found the same things
as others found.


He possessed himself with the same bounds
strolling through the same crowds.
Maybe he was scared to choose
underground,
maybe he was knocked down
by something ever bothering
and lost his original temperament.


He has got bored of life
and what's the reason?
Maybe because he didn't choose underground,
the way which is chosen by wise people
where they form and improve new skills,
that underground
is a place where
knowledge is found.









In the crosswalk



I was briskly passing the crosswalk
when all cars had been stopped,
I was going somewhere
but suddenly I met
someone,
nobody could stop me
that moment,
except that creature.

I felt myself like kept in a cage
I lost my consciousness,
I felt as if I have rage over myself
remembering the past poor events,
when that creature looked
at my eyes.

I fixed my eyes to hers
It was a minute here
in my mind,
and seemed like a century there
in my suffering heart.
I wanted to start
to converse to that person
but thoughts in my mind stopped me.


It made me feel as if I had done
something completely wrong,
I can clearly remember
I couldn't stand strong
although I was full of power
before our encounter.
Its eyes made me realize
I am already old
regardless my age,
left the sands of time
without any footprints, alas!









The first step



I came to this life
and frittered away my time
I was like a tree that was quiet for long
but now i am stepping barely-barely,
because fortunately,
books helped me to gain consciousness.


Finally, I broke my calmness and silence
Alas! It's very late,
I want these dismal days
to quickly pass,
before I opened my eyes
I was in a deep faint,
maybe because of my laziness.


My mind was full of stray dreams
which got out of my mind
and formed foams
to always remind me about my
mistakes I did
before gaining consciousness.










Lies surrounding me



How beautiful is this world
even wise and eloquent
can't find any word
to describe its beauty,
always words are crude
for its perfect amenities.

Sometimes world seems to me like
It's in its proper shape
and sometimes feels so upside down
that I feel as if I turned into a tramp
thrown by everyone.

Look at the world through a drop of rain
and without
then you will comprehend what I mean.

I want to make my feelings
as possible as plain
so as to avoid speaking in vain.

There are so many lies
which are classified to strong and weak
so be watchful and vigilant,
otherwise, you'll regret
whole your lifetime.









The balloon released to the Moon



One little boy quitted from his home
with a balloon
and ran directly to the hill
passing through dense hedges,
suddenly the balloon released
from his hands.


The boy looked up at the
balloon which was drifting away
far to the sky,
it was flying so fast
that the boy said:
"It has reached
troposphere, stratosphere
and higher
it fixed itself to the Moon
oh, it reached there."


Being convinced that the balloon
was gone
the boy sadly went back home.

The multi-coloured balloon
flew there for a while,
and blew up
but before, it made a harsh appeal:
"why did you take me
If you couldn't bear
even though I was easy?!"









Unlucky



Something is making me
feel desperate,
gaining what I don't wish to gain
and what I hate.

When I grasp something golden
all that is gold stop glittering,
as if i have bad deeds
which deprive me of my rewards.


We love the things we love for what they are...
But everything turns
to nothing for me
all my plans, dreams, goals are lost,
how about for thee?










Clown Fun



He is the real opponent
which you encounter with
every day of your life
to prolong life of yourself.

He is really beneficial, attractive
however, when you go profound in friendship
with him
he turns to be quite harmful and destructive
that it can kill all your dreams you have.

Try to restrain your enthusiasm
to clown called Fun,
befriend with him
but put a restriction.

I gave him a chance
to take away my the most
valuable dream
I wasn't attentive
whereas he was pounding my dream
to grinds
and now I regret about that
because at last he succeeded
in destroying my dream.

I want to give you an advice
to be wise in spending your time
Question yourself:
To go on being with Clown Fun
or with your dreams?









Loss of everything



She was thither, thither
and thither
then came here.


Before, when she went thither
she lost her all familiars,
when she went thither
she lost her possession she had,
when she went thither
she lost her soul and heart
then she came here,
she is standing and sobbing,
with sorrow and remorse
cursing her hubris.


The art of losing is not too
hard to master with arrogance
It can easily turn everything you have
into something lost, into nothingness.









The Minstrel



Such a pleasing voice
and an charming eloquence
the minstrel has,
with slow movements
of his mouth
he anthems his poems
capturing publics' ears
in the streets.

He makes revolted souls
calm,
tranquilizes ears with stinging-sensation,
changes moods in any direction,
when he sings an encouraging poem
It makes fear disappear.

Beautiful shape of his poems
is something essential
that attracts persons
because any of them
contains beauty.

It finds a splinter left
anywhere in your heart,
by becoming your best friend
poem gives you its hand.

Read them,
listen to them
to avoid to be astray
in your right way.









Peaceful old man



Heart sings a song
with fussy composition
until another heart comes
and whispers back.

An old man always has complaints
so don't pay attention,
he doesn't know what to do
with his wild and precious life,
pointing on himself with a knife
wishing to fall asleep
and make the knife
penetrate into his heart.

He thinks he is mental
and useless
as if there is nobody else
who would love to be with him.

Dealing with such brutal hardships
he doesn't know
whether unbeing dead
is being alive or not.

Nobody is going to hold
his perpetually trembling hands
as if he is not alive for others
but only for himself.

Some say the world will end
with fire,
some say with ice.
Old man knows
that he will die
before the world turns into bonfire
or ice.









Bookworm



Listen to the song of nature,
eye the beauty of the sky
and try to find glorious creature
in the wide-open sight.

If it is possible
speak a few reasonable words
to make your break time
more lively and flamboyant.

I should note an issue
that you are going to have,
sometimes, your negative signals
of struggles
are going to increase,
you can be depressed so profoundly
that all the parts of your body
will tell you to stop reading.

In times of such distractions
do what I said above
then go back to your books.

If you want to be smart and eloquent,
make your own plans
of your day
and avoid not following them.









You live only twice



You live only twice,
to make them easy
try to find ways
of making them
easy while you have time.

If you want to be among
good human beings,
whose both lives
are perfect,
whose akin lives are given
and lived only few times,
try to find your way
because you live only twice:

once when you are born
and once when you look death
in the face.








First steps



Trying to say
something great is a great
deal
because it shows your eloquence
and the way your brain thinks.

If you are late in learning
If you want to start to act
in the world of men,
say to yourself that you are a hero
make a determined rule
to read myriad of pages every day."

For me it's my deepest regret
to start reading so late,
at my eighteen,
when I am getting closer and closer
to my death.








Gigantic hyacinth landed beside the waterfall...




There was a waterfall
among the woods
by which gigantic hyacinth
was passing.

The passer-by landed on
one sleek pebble
located among large boulders
to get pleasure of the beautiful
sight of nature,
to listen to roars of other unalike
animals roaring from far beyond woods
and at the same time echoing
in mountain ranges.

It was as if someone from behind
intruded into landers relaxation
and slipped him down.

It fell and banged into
the surface of water,
splashing drops onto
all directions and making big ripples,
it swooned there
then water took it and embraced,
pulled down and down
until it reached the deepest point.









I am here



I am already born,
maybe, ages and ages far away
from you
in period about you only heard of
but have never seen.

I am writing this poem
to make you familiar with myself,
with all my feelings
that I feel always whenever I am alone.

Melancholia is filler of all my organs,
It is oppressor of my satisfaction and
happiness.

Maybe, the only thing I can do
to expel it from inside
Is to share my feelings with you,
my dear friend.

Do you want me to come up with
a smiling face?
I practiced it a lot of times,
though my smile expresses deep disgrace
instead of joyful glory,
don't ignore me.








My room



My life...
seems like excitingly interesting
yet extremely hard,
but feels like,
as if I am locked in a room
and hence I must be the one,
this room is fabricated for,
nobody shall live here after me anymore...
