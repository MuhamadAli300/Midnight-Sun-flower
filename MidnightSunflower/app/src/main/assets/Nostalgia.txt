All around the bonfire



How many people were
around that bonfire,
around which we were
supporting each other
in our easy and hard days?

I can't count now,
nobody is there,
except me and my rough life.

Oh, Lord forgive my impertinent
and rude jokes on my friends,
I didn't want to offend any of them,

just wanted to entertain myself
and others around that bonfire.
Make them and me sit together again,
direct us to that good night
left by everyone in the distant past.

I will be an upright person
and obey the rules
you put in these woods
like a child who obeys the rules
which its mother puts.

Let us be together again,
let us sit on the same stumps
and let us tell different true jokes
which will make us forget bad memories
and remember the good ones.









Pity Wanderer



I took a homeless path
and decided to wander,
my way laid
to a distant forest,
there I saw a lot of woods,
looking at the dismal weather
I decided to lie on a green ground.

I was lying silent
with eyes fixed on the sky
but suddenly one fellow with a hat
approached me and greeted.


He looked cordial and favorable
at first,
however suddenly
i realized this was illusion,
he showed himself
as a rude host,
he swore innumerable times,
made me stand
and sent me back
where I had come from.









African chamomiles



We are too many in the world
the Earth is still bearing us,
when they are usually born
they get a misery called poorness
at once.


They are poor chamomiles of South
thrown by people of North, West, East
" Welcome our guest!
look at our drought and still ground
It doesn't have any bound,
this is a boundless land,
we're almost dead and exhausted!


You have everything
but you don't have right to be proud
of that
because we, your brothers and sisters
in Africa,
don't even have our own shrouds!"









My Timi



All day and night
the Sun and the Moon were bright,
their lights were kissing my body
and I was looking for you, my Timi.

We have so much of our own memories
for example, your habit to fight
with the reflection of yourself on the mirror,
"What a cute weirdo?"
I would say, looking at you.


And I say now:
"You left me forever"
(in despair).
My best friend, my comforter,
I would say,
let's drink some milk and water
but now no one's with me.


I sigh in distress
as to whom can ever feel
the love between that pet and me,
a human being...


And now, I have no company
to hence share those bits of my grieves
filling my heart and thenceforth, my body
I lost myself among those, missing
those days of us... just myself and you, Timi.


I don't know if you're alive or not
but even when the day was hot
and the night was cold,
I looked for you
hoping to find thee
but everything was in vain.


Maybe right now you're
with your new boss,
maybe with other cats
or maybe you are wandering in the streets
and need to eat disgusting rats.

My cute Freundin,
come back home
I want to give thee a kiss,
don't deprive me of this,
for me
every second of spending my time
with you is a big bliss.









Unquenched melancholy



I could go along the park
beside a skyline-silver lake,
where trouts would dive-bomb
themselves,
seeing elusive butterflies,
listening to birds' chirp,
and dogs easy and merry bark.


I could go to that resplendent park,
In times of my melancholy,
to cease my melancholy to be at peace,
and gaze scrubs of moss,
lichen grown on rocks and trees
but now every beauty and scent of
mother nature there... is gone.


I live there where I am not satisfied
I would move to the moon,
mars, jupiter or saturn
but they are all the same
and our earth becoming the same as them.


My melancholy is unquenched,
I am filled with a feeling of pensive sadness
I am going to die soon, I suppose.









The day we met



I remember that day and admire
when we met one another
not in Paris,
not in front of Eiffel tower
but in a bazaar
in a modest fair.

I remember your big, radiant eyes
which were radiating light more intense
than sun's rays.

I was open-mouthed
and then recollected
and smiled to you
and you did the same to me,
as if, I was a beggar
who begs for love,
and as if you were the person
who could give me that love
I was begging for.

Our meeting continued
only seven seconds
then your parents called you
from behind,
I, myself, was surprised
by forgetting to greet you and them
although, I knew the reason.

It was that I was stupefied
just by looking at thee.

You left me after
our 7 seconds' meeting,
in those seven seconds
I realized one thing,
love cannot be concealed
as a cough cannot be:
even a small cough,
even a small love.

To find love in myself
I listened to my heart for a while,
to find love in you to me
I remembered your impassioned smile
and then, I decided not time
answers all
but to look for your home.

And for my fortune
I found it, you were single
then, at once I sent my parents
there for proposal
and you accepted.
