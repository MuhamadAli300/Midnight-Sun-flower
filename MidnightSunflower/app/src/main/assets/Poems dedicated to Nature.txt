Don't cut forests Woodcutter 



There is a beautiful forest of Uganda

full of trees and flowers

with Sun's golden rays, 

there are concrete steps 

covered by overgrown grass 

trampled by adventurers 

which is adorning the path.



Trees are really different 

from trees of other forests, 

they have fairly large and long branches

 on their bodies like cedars and firs, 

under them, on their thick roots 

there are little, fallen branches, 

I see that all from afar, beyond my windows. 



High and fat figures of trees

are catching Sun's rays 

which are falling on the hard

 crust of the ground. 



Everything in silence seems okay

but I observe sad look of trees

foreshadowing something fearful

probably, their bodies are being intensely heated by Sun's rays

 or maybe, woodcutters are coming

 with their frightening saws and axes.



Oh no, they are coming

 and I know why, 

to deprive the forest of its benefactors 

and beauties, 

trees which are releasing oxygen

and cooling down temperature of Earth, 

it is turn for our forest to be cutten.



50 men came on their carts, 

took their axes and saws

to start to cut 

but I am going out with a shout: 

" where is your conscience? 

Are you really going to kill this beauty?"



I can't see any sign of understanding 

of what I said 

on their red faces, 

as though they don't have ears 

or as though I spoke in incomprehensible language 

"Hey infant, leave us as soon as possible!" 

they snorted, 

unfortunately, forces weren't equal 

I sprinted back home 

"Mom, call the police": I exclaimed.



She called to the forest incumbent 

and he said that 

the order to cut the wood 

was given by the government.



I was astonished 

government gives such orders?

Do they understand that 

future generations will live on the earth, 

not in another planet? What are we going to reach 

by cutting such precious and inimitably beautiful forests?



We are going to just kill our home 

in which we enjoy our every day 

and breathe. 

Words were booming out from my heart, 

don't they realise 

that we don't live here eternally? 

God exists, we will be in front of Him 

and will be asked about what we were doing in this life.



I look at their faces 

the woodcutters are working with ecstasy, 

love, real love to money and 

shiny widely open eyes. 

About how to help this little wood I think, 

pray with fierce drops of sadness.



Yes! I will write a letter to the leader, 

In spite of my eyes 

weeping bitter drops 

depriving me of my vision, 

I started writing my letter: 



"How do you do, your excellency? 

Your woodcutters are working, 

they are really loyal to you, 

I can say that looking 

at how they are working briskly 

maybe owing to loyalty 

or love for money. 

Here, I am sitting on the corner 

of my home suffering from what is

happening in front of my eyes. 

This is really dreadful 

to see how they are happy with 

what they are doing, 

Your excellency, please hasten 

when you are with us, 

a lot of things are allowed and fine, 

with you we can stop this crime. 

I beg you, after all you are gracious 

after all, everyone does what you say, 

no one can resist your decision, 

So please hasten!" 



Yes! 

I have written my letter 

but how to send it? 

I am inquiring my mother. 

When I showed her my reference 

I saw a pity look on her face 

cast on mine. 

Indeed it was no just pity, 

it was admiration mixed with pity, 

she observed a feeling 

of patriotism in her son 

but her next face expression 

I noticed it meant 

that it was too late.



Now I am sitting and weeping... 

After sometime 

I fell asleep on the corner 

without any comforter for my grief. 

I woke up lately 

during the twilight, 

when the moon was substituting the Sun 

with its silverly-bright light. 

I looked through my window 

and saw only bald hills, 

the disappearance of tall trees 

was making me think 

as if those hills were bald always. 



It looked as if there was no grass 

although, it was just laying trampled, 

unfortunately, as I supposed, 

I could see only 

stairs, trampled flowers and stumps, 

nothing else 

Who cares?.. Who cares?..

 Who cares?








Our home 



We were sent here, 

to the earth, 

as cute creatures 

to make our lives and the world 

beautiful and prosperous. 

Instead, we wholly changed our features 

we drained our home 

and made exhausted our Mother Nature 

with those dark steams. 



We are 

leaving behind us draughts and floods

 for our future generations, 

oh, my son 

I want everyone to understand

right now what's going on, 

You should become a person who can change 

the whole world, 

time to battle against unfairness.



My son, I don't know 

how it is going to be hard 

I will be asking in my prayers with tears 

to make you that hero who will save and 

restore our home

 to its beautiful pristine condition.



Maybe it seems like 

your father is raving 

and telling you unreachable dream 

similar to fiction.



No, if God wills,

you can reach any of your dreams, 

God always gives us best benisons 

when we ask Him with raised hands. 

Help your home to get rid of harm 

and restore it, 

don't believe in the delusion 

about irrestorability of our Home-Planet!



My God, relieve our new generation's future 

and make our Home more graceful, 

this is our Home

our fathers and mothers lived in 

in peace with nature.










Beauty of morning 



Beautiful morning 

coming from North-East 

with a shining ball called "the Sun", 

It grew bright and red 

facing the earth and substituting the moon. 

In my imagination 

these heavenly bodies are like collection 

of balloons of different colours. 



So pleasant to see 

the Sun throwing its light 

onto the scattered trees 

on the hill, garden, field, 

everywhere. 



The grass is sheltered 

by shadows of woods 

from illuminations 

and is swayed in different directions. 



Mill is grinding what it should grind 

likewise, plants are making hints 

about what they are engaging in 

what they should be engaged in.

Wouldn't such a beautiful view 

have beckoned you?










Beautiful science 



The Sun throws its light worldwide, 

passes across the vacuum of space 

to reach Earth's surface 

and to yield light 

falls like a golden thread. 



The Moon, 

moonlight consists of mostly sunlight 

(with little earthlight), 

reflected from the parts 

of the Moon's surface 

where the Sun's light strikes. 



Moon's light travels on space 

as of the sun does.

Moon's light looks peculiar, 

it lays on the Earth's surface 

with a silver colour. 



And hence, our Earth, 

our Home, takes benefits 

of those astronomical objects.










Nature's perfume 



World was going, 

the bells of morning were ringing, 

the sun and the clear pebbles 

of rain were moving across the landscapes, 

over prairies and trees, 

the mountains and the rivers 

like yesterday. 



You didn't see 

and welcome that beautiful sight of morning nature 

because you were 

passing your night pissed and locked in your chamber. 



Meanwhile, flocks of geese, 

high in air, under the bright sun's rays 

were heading home again 

you still were in depression. 



Look at Mary's words 

who I am trying to remind about 

from whom I learned many things, 

at least, you should read one piece 

to learn how to get rid of desperate feeling:



"Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, 

the world offers itself to your imagination, 

calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and 

exciting â€“ 

over and over announcing your place 

in the family of things." 











Criminal 



You are splendid today, 

look how you are highly exalted, 

you are swimming in a pool of money 

and fame. 



However you forgot 

to look at your back, 

to see what your deeds are causing, 

big scales are brimming with water 

like a brimming glass 

big scales are dipping into fires, 

how on Earth 

can you be so proud 

after bringing us natural terrible disasters? 



Now Mother Nature melded 

all of her anger 

and trying to avenge for the murder 

of trees you cut 

and fuels you used. 



Who is going to take responsibility 

I would ask you, your excellency? 

When your richness caused your delusion 

and made your eyes blind 

you are inducing 

humanity's death, 

open your eyes.
