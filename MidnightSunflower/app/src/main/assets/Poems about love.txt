I walk along a path
full of fragrant roses
covered with red tops
fluctuating slowly in winds
like sea waves.

Seeing this alluring view
I calmly breath and try to forget
bad recollections I always harked back to,
and tiny butterflies with red wings
join me to help to do it...

And sun in flight sends its
golden rays with rapid pace
to show real beauty of all creations
adorning earth's face.

But wind with the air that kills
blows onto flattering flowers and me
then those sad recollections
thrill my physical senses.









Wild fire



How many times I tried to tell you
about a fierce burning fire inside of me,
it is pulling with a great force to thee
to make you aware of itself.

I feel exceedingly nervous
sitting on a bench,
thinking how to become conscious,
and asking that blaze for help.

I stand up, go right, go left
and sit down on the same place...
consciousness doesn't come,
the wildfire is still there
breaking my silence and calm.








Whirlpool



So many things congregated
in that whirlpool
that nothing else can penetrate
because it is already
overfilled.

There are futile letters,
ungiven roses and a ring,
everything that is beautiful
is thrown to that whirlpool.

They are not heavy but big in size
and they are filling the pool,
really amazing
to see that everything left
in the past.









Don't wreck me like a ship



Strongly I want to look at the eyes
and feel your wings in my embrace
but I can't even fix my face on yours
to at least catch your eyes
looking at mine.

Look at my eyes,
give me a chance,
at the least, for 2 seconds,
otherwise, I am going to weep
like a child in the kindergarten.
You told me not
in mournful numbers
although, I had such a gentle dream
but it is empty, it doesn't seem,
it already is.

My life is fleeting
extremely swiftly
and it seems like I'm close
to my grave,
though, my heart is still
wild and brave.

Look at my eyes, my bird,
otherwise,
I can't go forth
forthwith, look at me
let me live longer
and pursue you again and again,
I am not tough,
I will just look, though,
after, I am going to think about you
every day, hour, minute, millisecond
but those thoughts for you
will be insignificant.

So look at me
don't screw my everything up,
don't let me wander alone
like a cloud
floating on the sky
singing sad song.










Bright daffodils



A bouquet of bright daffodils
were resting in your jar
with their petals
bent into single direction.

They were standing in your
windowsill
looking at far and high hill
which was resting
with its grass and other daffodils
behind a wood.

They were admiring with
the freedom of their
self-same classified flowers
grown on that hill free even of trees.

Daffodils behind the wood
were fluttering and dancing
with breathe of freedom
continuously like the stars that shine
and twinkle on the milky way endlessly,
whereas, daffodils on your windowsill
were praying to God
to get rid of you
and asking to make their prayers
soon to come true.









Wonderful encounter



The day we met
you caught me tightly into your net,
& when I gazed steadily your eyes
I forgot everything I possessed,

Your lulling and mesmerizing eyes
affected my alien mind,
and tidied it from all those delusions
about the magical love I had.

Belief which is inside of you...
Your lovely little eyes, nose and ears...
remind me about
two of the most beauteous
acts of life
to pray every day and to love.
