The Brave Knight



The brave Knight
Son: "today the weather is clement"
Father: "yes, it is"
Son: "father I want to ask you something"
Father: "I am listening"
Son: "I want to tell you my dream,
I want to become a brave knight
father, give me an example
from your experience
about a bravery of the best knight
you have ever met
and I promise
I will be brave like him"
Father: "Hmm, you want to be brave?
Well, I am really happy to hear that
I knew one peasant
who always dressed poorly,
with perpetually shabby clothes
which were
inappropriate to rules and codes
of knights,
he didn't have a chain mail,
sword and armours.

Once he left his home
looking for adventures,
the only thing he had
was his brave heart.

On that adventure
he chose a forest to go to,
he alone fought against 7 jackals
which were threatening kids,
he helped to greybeard
to pass a long and thin like a thread bridge.

During his adventure
he would never think about stopping
performing such feats,
even though there were a lot of monsters
which wanted him to give up
and be eaten by them
but he stood strong,
he was already determined to sacrifice
himself for his fate
and his heart was sealed with that purpose.

Once, he encountered
with one peaceful village
where he had to be expired
according to his fate.
He protected the village successfully
with his clever plans
made for opposing to dragons.

That was a complicated battle
he got a wound which was fatal,
he was close to his death
and before dying
he uttered one beautiful phrase:

"'Now I should die,
I always tried to stand brave,
my bravery encouraged me to perform feats
think only this of me...'
write these words on my grave."









Work in team



One day, football players
on wise man's way
were expressing their same opinions
everyone's opinion would say:

"I have my own idea
about how I should play,
so no need for conductor
to show me my way during the game."

Having heard those words
man said:
"You are more liable to be defeated
rather than to win."
No one paid any attention
to his words
except the eldest one,
he was poor so for him the match
was important.

He decided to find
the wise anyways.
When that fellow
found the wise's trace
he understood how far his way was laid.

It was that
It was going to take 8 days,
but his game was going
to start very anon.
Without changing his mind,
making strong efforts
on the way
he reached the man in six days.

Ten minutes earlier fellow
reached the wise,
he had heard on the broadcast
that
his team was defeated.

When the fellow asked the wise
why they were liable to be defeated,
the wise's answer was:
"None of us is as smart as all of us."









Neglected robot



Everything was happening in spring
when days grow warm,
when on the plants, the new buds form
and bees and bugs come out to swarm.

One day, robot Mike had to go to school
where he had a lot of hostiles
who wouldn't at least try to avoid Mike
but would try to tease and poke fun at him.

Robot Mike had every necessary parts
which robots need,
mug with handles to hear,
copper wire to catch signals
and even TV screen in his stomach
which didn't work,
the only thing he lacked
was having familiars.

He didn't have parents
but only robotic engineer who created him
but he was already dead
so nobody would carry Mike to school.

He went to school alone
walking there in the style of march,
where his hostiles
were waiting for him
on the bottom of stairs.

He went into his school
then he was pacing swiftly
with huge steps
to avoid encountering those hostiles,
however, three of them had been already
waiting for him with fury,
one of them asked Mike:

"Did you fix your tiny TV screen Mike?
For long time we have been missing
watching it!"

He was terrified,
his terrified face changed
from terrified to dull,
he made two doubtful steps forward
but his hostiles made a barrier
and pulled him back.

Even though, Mike was stronger than
ten men combined in one,
he couldn't beat them
because he had a kind mechanism
so there was no way to pass except one.

Mike answered:
"I didn't, because that's expensive
I have answered and even told the reason,
let me pass now."
One of them:
"Look how poor you are,
you would rather have killed yourself
in despair, than to live in such life
nobody cares about you, you have nobody,
you don't even worth a nail of human beings
you are just a machine."

Those were words which had never been
uttered about him,
hearing those words for Mike was
equal to offend whole his being.

He cried and pulled them all strongly,
that was sufficient
to scatter them to three directions.

After weeping without tears
in a toilet
he got out to a corridor,
not noticing a person standing in front of him,
he bumped into that someone
and after some seconds he recognised his
director.

Mike's limbs started to tremble,
he was utterly terrified
like a terrified rabbit,
the director cried out:
"You fool, why aren't you in your class?"
Mike cast down his eyes,
the director
without waiting for Mike's answer, said
"March! To the class!"
Then Mike marched away from there
promptly,
without looking back,
to join the class being late.

He went into the classroom,
teacher was speaking and students were
listening,
the teacher frowned
and showed his contempt in his countenance
and made Mike to leave not just the classroom
but school
until Mike brings his parents,
so he could never go back
because he didn't have his own.

After remembering he didn't have parents
he felt stimulations
of his contempt to himself.

He left his school
then ran, ran and ran
far away thither,
where there a lot of  calm
to get rid of all dejections.
While he was running
he saw beauties which
he had never seen
and which was impossible for him to imagine
with his mechanical brain.

During the fog of late afternoon sun,
during the smooth swirl and flow of the clouds
across the sky,
during the fade of the bustling day
Mike was present there.

He saw how each star comes out to shine,
how the wind rustles across the land,
and how the moonlight sweeps across
everything around.

He sat on one of the benches
to enjoy an incredible beauty of sight
which was in front
of himself.

He continued gazing the beauty
to settle himself down completely,
of course, those miracles made him settle
down
and they made his sadness tail off,
his body seemed as if
he was dead
without anything or anyone with him
but only that beautiful sight
which he couldn't imagine
but could only dream about.
