My dear reader, today you are holding a book of poetry in your hands. I ventured to write this book along time ago and as you see, I successfully made it happen. I would like to tell you about this book plainly, I withdrew most of my feelings from my soul decidedly, wrote them on blank pieces of paper and gathered all those into this book hoping that this book will serve you and in general our society, and therefore become a beneficial treasure of reader's life (as it became mine already). 

I positively hope that my poems will drive exciting response from different crowds. Also, I anticipate that you will find your inner-self in these poems you are going to read. In this book, I've tried my best to synchronize my poems with beautiful minds of great people the world has produced so far, in order to make my poems more lovely and comprehensive, which means there are some great quotations by them. I should acknowledge that I am the product of my vicinity, shaped by my family, who has been authoring the poetry of my life.

I want to quote those great meaningful words, of one of the greatest writers, which I found myself in: "Why should search engineer usually be immersed in savoring the joys of mathematics and technology, get interested in poetry and short-stories? Because, it fascinated me to crack the mystery behind the alluring appeal of great literary works and tried to fit it in a rule based "fuzzy algorithm" to understand the source of its magic." Again, I hope you will find your inner-self in these poems.
